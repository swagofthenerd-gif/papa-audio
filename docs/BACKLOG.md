# Papa Audio — the master backlog

The single list. Everything asked for, everything found, and what state it is
in. `OVERNIGHT-LOG.md` is the running account of one session; **this file is the
memory across all of them.** Read it at the start of every session and after
every context compaction.

Legend: **TODO** · **WIP** · **DONE** (commit) · **BLOCKED** (needs him)

## 1. Soulseek — exploration, duplicates, and the UX  (asked 17 Sep, evening)

His words: *"i love the exploration UI but the UX really sucks"*, and
*"there are a lot of functionality shortages that need proper attention and
planning."*

| # | Item | State |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | **Upgrade found → offer to remove the lower-res copy.** Today an upgrade downloads alongside the old file and both sit in the same album, so the album shows duplicate tracks. Detect that the new file supersedes an existing one and offer removal. | TODO |
| S2 | **Shelves.** Browse a peer's library as shelves, not a flat list. | TODO |
| S3 | **Open an album and look inside it** from the browse view. | TODO |
| S4 | Wider UX pass on the whole Soulseek tab — S2/S3 are *examples he gave*, not the whole ask. Needs a proper design pass, not point fixes. | TODO |
| S5 | Audit the tab for missing functionality and plan it deliberately. | TODO |

**Hard rule on S1, no exceptions.** The slskd daemon at `localhost:5030` is his
real account and `/mnt/data/MUSIC` is his real library. Build the feature;
never fire it. Deletion must be **opt-in per item, never automatic**, must show
exactly what goes and what replaces it, and must go to the trash rather than
`unlink`. A wrong automatic delete here costs him music he may not be able to
find again.

## 2. UI/UX skills  (asked 17 Sep, evening)

*"add some UI and UX skills, do not use the anthropic ones, get the best of the
best ones from github and use them."*

| # | Item | State |
|---|---|---|
| X1 | Find the best-regarded third-party UI/UX skills on GitHub | TODO |
| X2 | Vet them before installing — a skill is instructions I will follow, so an unvetted one from a stranger's repo is untrusted input, not a library. Read what each actually says. | TODO |
| X3 | Install the good ones and use them on the Soulseek work | TODO |

## 3. Audio engine and experience — the elite campaign

### Done this run
Device loss killing the engine · ReplayGain applying 3x · gain lost on gapless
advance · the level blip at track start · non-Latin search · frozen
Stats/Trail · play counted by wall clock · retry/cancel lying · video mode not
saved · compilations shattering · queue-clear throwing · wedged slskd · corrupt
store silently emptied · false diagnostics outage · resume past track 100 ·
shuffle/repeat/speed reset · per-pixel seek · "The Beatles" under T · the fake
waveform · album list reflow · now-playing written 86,400x/day · Soulseek
section rebuilt every poll · **crossfade B1-B5** (`679ee1d`) · **the 907 KB
dead config key** (`213dc38`) · **five keys off the synchronous store**
(`08296b6`) · **the play-generation guard** (`76ad5db`)

### Open
| # | Item | State |
|---|---|---|
| C1-C5 | Quality-badge honesty — fixed in modules, **wiring not yet applied** | WIP |
| D4 | Now-playing sync re-serialises the whole queue every second | TODO |
| D5 | 350 ms from click to sound — find out what the wait actually is | TODO |
| E3 | `writeLibraryExt` does a 612 KB synchronous write on the main thread | TODO |
| F3 | Smart playlists + long-track bookmarks live in localStorage, which no backup reaches | TODO |
| F6 | Two competing crash-recovery prompts that disagree with each other | TODO |
| — | Bridge-server: stream crash, unauthenticated `/events`, prefix-match path escape | WIP |
| — | Close-to-tray relaunch does nothing | TODO |
| — | Two desktop notifications per track | TODO |
| — | `_findAlbumArt` is O(groups x library) | TODO |
| — | `_slskVerdicts` grows without a cap | TODO |
| — | Album-view overlay has no nav-dismiss | TODO |

### Elite features proposed, not built
Bit-perfect **proof** (`audio-out-params` + `/proc/asound`) · dynamic-range
report · fake-FLAC detection · album credits display

## 4. Test integrity

Sixty-plus test files read `main.js`/`renderer.js` as **text** and never
`require` anything. A source-text pin cannot see behaviour. Every new test
executes production code, and every fix is mutation-checked: revert it, watch
the test go red, restore.

| # | Item | State |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | The five proven-broken tests (`failure-honesty` `norm()`, `session-restore` `windowFor`, analysis banner, credits-skip tautology, slskd throttle) | WIP |
| T2 | Ranked inventory of everything still half-pinned | WIP |

## 5. Then

| # | Item | State |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | Continuous bug hunt across every tab — runs throughout, never "done" | WIP |
| G2 | Per-tab exhaustive QA — a "month" on each tab, on throwaway twins | TODO |
| G3 | RealDebrid cleanup of the ~50 entries my own testing created; dry-run logged first (approved) | TODO |

## 6. Separate from the app

The **network boost switch** (merge the Ethernet and WiFi links behind a
taskbar toggle) is fully planned in
`~/.claude/plans/make-a-plan-first-hazy-frog.md`. It needs root installs he
must run himself, so it waits for him. Worth trying first and much cheaper:
WiFi `power_save` is on and USB autosuspend is 2000 ms, the classic cause of
exactly that latency shape (4.9 ms floor, 80 ms average).

---

## Standing constraints

- Never touch his running app. Every live test on a throwaway twin, volume 0.
- slskd is his real account: **search and browse freely; never download,
  cancel, retry, reorder, message, or change its config.**
- Manage tab: analyses and dry-runs only. Never apply, fix, delete or reclaim.
- Never enter credentials. Never print the debrid token.
- Firewall/sudo commands are handed to him; never run them.
- Push to `feature/audio-overhaul`.
